Stay tuned and keep the spark going!\nWhat to Expect I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing about:\nTech Hacks: Most of the time, truth in tech doesn\u0026rsquo;t reside in reports or posts but hidden in code. I enjoy digging these gems out to see the real flow. Different AI Research: I continuously keep track of frontier AI research and especially favor the non-incremental ones, like new architectures to model intelligence. Stories and Gossip: The true frontier trends and news usually come from stories and gossip shared through friends, meetups, or conferences.

Starting a blog isn’t as easy as it seems—I don’t want to waste people’s time with casual anecdotes.

Yet almost everyone I followed stopped posting in early 2025. I understand the shifts and hype in SF lately that keep everyone busy building and/or financially free. Still, I’d be sad if this vibe disappears—it’s been truly helpful to me over the past few years, along with many others.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Why I start to write"},{"content":" Binfeng Xu I\u0026rsquo;m a research engineer at NVIDIA cooking autonomous NeMo Agents \u0026ndash; from model training to runtime scaffolding.\nFormerly, I was a researcher at Samsung Research (SRA) where I led LLM post-training + distillation infra.
