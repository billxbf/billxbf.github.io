This is a fairly procrastinated start to my personal blog. Starting a blog isn’t as easy as it seems—I don’t want to waste people’s time with casual anecdotes. Meanwhile, an overly formal academic write-up would likely be overkill and scare people away.

There are many people who truly enjoy machine learning and find joy in sharing knowledge. I’ve been a long-time follower of AI/tech blogs from [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io/), [Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/), [Yao Fu](https://yaofu.notion.site/), and others. 
I usually prefer blogs over papers because blogs feel more honest and less AI-polished (or written to attract citations). Yet almost everyone I followed stopped posting in early 2025. I understand the shifts and hype in SF lately that keep everyone busy building and/or financially free. Still, I’d be sad if this vibe disappears—it’s been truly helpful to me over the past few years, along with many others.

I’ve been more of a builder than a writer, hesitant to publish conclusions without solid ground. But lately I’ve found it really fruitful to do deep dives into the state of things and the literature before engineering. A blog of “study notes” not only helps me organize thoughts, but also carries on that missing vibe of sharing knowledge in a blunt and unpretentious way. And so I finally made up my mind to start writing—and I truly hope you enjoy it. Stay tuned and keep the spark going!




## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Tech Hacks**: Most of the time, truth in tech doesn't reside in reports or posts but hidden in code. I enjoy digging these gems out to see the real flow.
- **Different AI Research**: I continuously keep track of frontier AI research and especially favor the non-incremental ones, like new architectures to model intelligence.
- **Stories and Gossip**: The true frontier trends and news usually come from stories and gossip shared through friends, meetups, or conferences.
